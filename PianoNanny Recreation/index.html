            <h3>A testimonial from one of our students:</h3>
            
            <em>
                <p>“I took a general music GCSE at school aged 16, and ended up totally lost and bewildered with the theory. I never really got started trying to learn piano and have always regretted it. On a total whim whilst Christmas shopping, I bought myself a Yamaha keyboard with the intention to try again and I am so glad I did and that I found pianonanny. In the space of a few days I have worked my way through the beginner class and can honestly say I have learned more in these few days than in 2 years at school.</p>
            
                <p>I tried a few different sites before I found pianonanny and after a few simple lessons they all invariably wanted money to continue. I have found pianonanny to be a much better learning tool than any of them. What a pleasure to find a site that really wants to help you. The lessons are explained very well, with the audio clips a great help. Congratulations on an excellent site and thank you. I have found a new pleasure in life and I am extremely grateful to you.</p>
            
                <p>Best Wishes,</p>
            
                <p>Craig Wilson.”</p>

            <h3>How to begin your lessons</h3>
            
            <p>When you are ready to proceed, go to the top of this page and under the “Starter Studies” drop-down menu select “Lesson 1.” See figure one below. This will present you with a list of all the pages in Lesson 1. Select “<strong>Starter Studies – Lesson One: Page 1</strong>” to begin. Each lesson takes about 35 minutes to complete.  However, work slowly and at your own pace.  It’s important to learn each lesson before moving on to the next.</p>
